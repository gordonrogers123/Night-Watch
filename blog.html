                    <p class="blog-body">It seems everyone is fond of using the new <a href="tracker.html">UFO tracker</a>, judging by the dozens of emails we receive every week from people telling us that there was something in the sky and no satellites in their area at
                        the time. To make this easier on everyone, we have added a <a href="reporting.php">reporting form</a> where you can log the location, date, and time that you saw the UFO (I still can't get used to calling them UAPs). Hopefully
                        with enough data, we can start seeing patterns emerge. Thank you to everyone for doing your part.</p>

                    <h4 class="blog-timestamp">9/2/2021</h4>
                    <p class="blog-body">Could this be one of the earliest known artistic renditions of an extraterrestrial? These giant desert figures in Blythe, California, known as the Blyth Intaglios, are arguably the most famous geoglyphs in the United States, and just
                        happen to be located in the heart of the E.T. Highway. They are estimated to originate any ware from 900 BCE to 1200 CE, based on radiocarbon dates for the figures.
                        <br><br> I'll admit, it doesn't look like any person I've ever seen. But, then again, I never was much of an artist. Perhaps these ancient ancestors of ours did see visitors from another planet flying overhead. If that were true,
                        it makes sense that they might try to communicate with images only visible from above. Who else would they be trying to communicate with up there?</p>

                    <p class="blog-body">Did you ever see something flying in the sky and you didn't know what you were seeing? Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO), or what the military is now calling Unidentified Arial Phenomena (UAP), are often dismissed as private and commercial
                        aircraft, satellites, or even natural phenomena (swamp gas, anyone?). Well now you can rule out arial sightings of terrestrial origin with our UFO Tracker.
                        <br><br> This page asks you to enter your zip-code and will present you with a list of satellites flying overhead. So the next time you see something overhead that you can't explain, give it a try. If there isn't a satellite above
                        you at the time, well... it just might be a UAP.</p>

                    <p class="blog-body">If you were trying to communicate with extraterrestrials, how would you do it? Radio waves sent into space? A vinyl record carried on a satellite sent beyond our solar system? Maybe drop a letter into The Black Mailbox in the middle
                        of the dessert? How about... a megaphone?.
                        <br><br> Just southeast of Baker, California, resting on a small hill, sits the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mojave-megaphone" target="_blank">Mojave Magaphone</a>: a dilapidated cylinder of metal that looks more
                        like a jet engine than a megaphone. Theories about the origins of the megaphone vary wildly; is it an art installation from some unknown sculptor? Or perhaps the military used it during the chemical and atomic weapons testing that
                        started in the 1950's... which many believe are still being conducted today. Whatever your theory is, the answer to its purpose remains a mystery.

                        <br><br> The desert feels that way too sometimes; out here in the Mojave Desert, you might be 100 miles from another living soul. That's a lot of space. You might be inclined to believe that no one is listening out here either.
                        But what if I told you, that out on 51 Rd in Nevada – The Extraterrestrial Road as some call it – there stands <a href="https://travelnevada.com/extraterrestrial/black-mailbox/" target="_blank">The Black Mailbox</a>. A mailbox
                        where letters are not bound for the US Mail, but for otherworldly readers instead. Here, true believers come from around the world hoping to communicate with life on other planets.
                        <br><br> If you decide to take the drive, just know that the area is very. Remote. There may be little or no cell phone reception. There may be no one around for miles. Meaning, if you did need to scream, there may be no one that
                        can hear you. At least... not down here.

                    <p class="blog-body">The long awaited <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-weigh-in-on-pentagon-ufo-report/" target="_blank">Pentagon Report</a> has finally been released, which documents numerous sightings reported by Air Force
                        and Navy pilots who have come in contact with Unidentified Areal Phenomena, or UAPs for short. While the report offers some much needed credibility to the community of true believers, it's still not the smoking gun we were all
                        hoping for.<br><br>Here's what the report tells us: We have video evidence from military aircraft encountering UAPs. We have detailed and <i>corraborated</i> accounts from multiple pilots of these encounters. We have the pentagon
                        openly admitting that these UAPs do in fact exist. We get admission that the sighting that we have been reporting all these years are not from advanced US military technology.<br><br> What we <i>don't</i> get, unfortunately, is
                        any admission from the government that they know what these UAPs are or why they're here. I'll just be honest; I'm sceptical... surprise! There is still more that they are hiding, still more they are not telling us, and still more
                        work to do, true believers.<br><br> Until next time, keep you eyes on the Night Watch.</p>
