                    <h4 class="blog-timestamp">1989-90</h4>
                    <p class="blog-body">At the end of November 1989, citizens of Belgium reported seeing a large, triangular UFO hovering in the sky. But beyond the visual sightings, no evidence was found of any UFO’s existence. <br><br>A few months later, in March 1990,
                        new sightings of multiple objects were reported, confirmed by two military ground radar stations. Two F-16 fighter jets were sent out to investigate the anomalies, and though the pilots could not see anything visually, they were
                        able to lock onto their targets with radar. But the UFOs moved so fast that the pilots ended up losing them.<br><br>Some 13,500 people are estimated to have witnessed the incident, making it one of the most widely experienced UFO
                        sightings of the modern era. The Belgian Air Force had no logical explanation for the activity, but it acknowledged that an unknown activity had taken place in the air. The Belgians reached out to the UK’s Ministry of Defence to
                        investigate further, but once they determined that the incident was not a hostile or aggressive one, they stopped the investigation.<a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufos-green-fireballs-nuclear-facilities-new-mexico">https://www.history.com/news/ufos-green-fireballs-nuclear-facilities-new-mexico</a>

                    <h4 class="blog-timestamp">1947</h4>
                    <p class="blog-body">It's possible that the story of the Men in Black, the mysterious figures that would become the subject of fascination in UFO conspiracy circles and eventually break into mainstream popular culture, can be traced back to one day: June
                        27, 1947. It's quite possible that it all started with a man, a boy and a dog on a boat.<br><br>As the story goes, Harold Dahl was on a conservation mission on the Puget Sound near the eastern shore of Washington’s Maury Island,
                        gathering logs, when he saw six donut-shaped obstacles hovering about a half a mile above his boat. Before long, one of them fell nearly 1,500 feet, followed by raining, metallic debris, some of which hit Dahl’s son, Charles, on
                        his arm, as well as the family dog, who didn’t survive the ordeal. Dahl was able to take some pictures of the aircraft with his camera, which he later showed to his supervisor, Fred Crisman. A skeptical Crisman went back to the
                        scene to look for himself and saw a strange aircraft with his own eyes.<br><br>The following morning, Dahl was visited by a man in a black suit. They end up at a local diner, where the man was able to recount in extraordinary detail
                        what Dahl had just experienced. “What I have said is proof to you that I know a great deal more about this experience of yours than you will want to believe,” the man said, according to author Gray Barker’s 1956 book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2415847.They_Knew_Too_Much_about_Flying_Saucers">They  Knew
                        Too Much About Flying Saucers.</a><br><br>Dahl was told not to speak of the incident. If he did, bad things would happen.<br><br>The supposed events of Maury Island have continued to fuel conspiracy theories to this day, even though
                        a U.S. government investigation deemed it a hoax after Dahl and Crimson later admitted as much. In particular, the mention of the man in the black suit would evolve into a key obsession for UFO enthusiasts and spread into American
                        popular culture, thanks to a comic-book series and a blockbuster movie trilogy.<br><br><a href="https://www.history.com/news/men-in-black-real-origins">https://www.history.com/news/men-in-black-real-origins</a></p>

                    <h4 class="blog-timestamp">1955</h4>
                    <p class="blog-body">Why are aliens so often depicted as “little green men” with bulbous heads and oversized eyes? <br>The mythology began, in part, on the night of August 21, 1955, when a large extended farm family called the Suttons arrived breathlessly
                        at the Hopkinsville police station in southwestern Kentucky. Their story of a terrifying siege by otherworldly beings would become one of the most detailed and baffling accounts of an alien close encounter on record—notable for
                        the large number of witnesses (nearly a dozen), the duration of the encounter (several hours) and the close proximity between the witnesses and creatures (sometimes just a few feet away). The incident quickly became regional and
                        even national news.<br><br>The alleged encounter occurred on the Suttons' farm in the tiny rural hamlet of Kelly, Kentucky, where the family lived in an unpainted three-room house without running water, telephone, radio, TV or
                        books. Of all the details of their story—the UFO landing and the appearance of small alien creatures—one fact is indisputable: When the eight adults and three children arrived at the nearby Hopkinsville police station at about
                        11 p.m., they were genuinely terror-struck. <br><br>“These aren’t the kind of people who normally run to the police for help,” police chief Russell Greenwell later told investigators. “What they do is reach for their guns.” Yet
                        here they were, women and children hysterical and one man with a pulse of 140 beats per minute, measured by an investigator.<br><br><a href="https://history.com/news/little-green-men-origins-aliens-hopkinsville-kelly">https://history.com/news/little-green-men-origins-aliens-hopkinsville-kelly</a></p>
